# Source-Camera-Identification-using-Local-Binary-Pattern
In digital image forensics, camera model identification seeks for the source camera model information from the given images under investigation. To achieve this goal, one of the popular approaches is extracting from the images under investigation certain statistical features that capture the difference caused by camera structure and various in-camera image processing algorithms, followed by machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms for similarity measures of extracted features. In this paper, we use uniform local binary patterns (LBP) as statistical features. LBP features encode local texture information and can be used for many tasks including classification, detection, and recognition. Three groups of each 59 local binary patterns are extracted from the spatial domain of red, green and blue color channels from each image respectively. Multi-class support vector machine is used for classification of 12 camera models from ‘Dresden Image Database’. We have achieved an accuracy of 97.69% for source camera identification using local binary pattern method.
